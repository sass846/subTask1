I read books (mostly fantasy epics). I love playing with tech. Basically I geek out when I see cool new tech. I watch movies a lot. And also I am a space enthusiast.

### Why do I want to contribute to open-source

To begin with, contributing to the open source helps me practice coding actively. I can develop my skills by writing code and reviewing the work of others. I can also get inspiration from open source. Exploring experienced developers' code allows me to learn from their techniques and approaches. Also, I've utilized many open-source tools and software in my life, from video editors to web browsers, so it's time for me to contribute something to the community and make myself helpful.
